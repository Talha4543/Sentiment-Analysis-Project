# 📊 Sentiment Analysis using LSTM Neural Network

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis** model using a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network.  
The model classifies text (e.g., movie reviews, tweets, or product feedback) into **positive** or **negative** sentiment.

LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited for sequential data, making them effective for natural language processing tasks.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of text (tokenization, stopword removal, padding)
- LSTM-based neural network for sequence modeling
- Trained on labeled sentiment datasets
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Inference script to predict sentiment of custom input text

🧠 Model Architecture
Embedding Layer – Converts words to dense vectors

LSTM Layer(s) – Captures long-term dependencies in sequences

Dropout Layer – Prevents overfitting

Dense Layer (Sigmoid) – Outputs sentiment probability
